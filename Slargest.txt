âœ… Optimized Approach (One Pass):
ðŸ”¸ Logic:
Keep track of:

first â†’ largest

second â†’ second largest

ðŸ”¹ Steps:
Initialize first = second = INT_MIN

Traverse the array:

If arr[i] > first, then:

second = first

first = arr[i]

Else if arr[i] > second && arr[i] != first, then:

second = arr[i]
